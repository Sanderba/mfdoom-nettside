           "This book celebrates Madvillainy as a representation of the melding of two genius musical minds",
           "MF DOOM and Madlib. Written from the alternating perspectives of three fake music journalist superheroes – featuring interviews with Wildchild, M.E.D, Daedalus, Stones Throw label executives, and many other individuals involved with the album's creation – this book blends fiction and non-fiction to celebrate Madvillainy not just as an album, but as a folkloric artifact. It is one specific retelling of a story which, like Madvillain's music, continues to spawn infinite legends.",
           "33 ⅓ is a series of short books, each devoted to different classic albums across all genres of music. The series was launched by Bloomsbury in 2003 and has published over 200 titles to date, including many focused on hip-hop favorites such J Dilla's Donuts, Nas’s Illmatic, Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp A Butterfly, Beastie Boys' Paul's Boutique, and more."
